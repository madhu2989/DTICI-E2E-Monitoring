# Changelog History
The changelog history displays all created, updated or deleted new elements of the Providence service.

All Create/Update/Delete config should be visible in some kind of history backlog. 
- If somebody changes an "State Increase Rule" we want to be able to track down who it was.
- If somebody removes a "Alert Ignore Rule" we need to know who did it.

All changes in the model of tree elements (Environment/Service/Action/Component) are exclude because these are changed frequently by the users.
