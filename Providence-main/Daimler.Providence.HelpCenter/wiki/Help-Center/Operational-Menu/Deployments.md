## Deployments

The Deployment notifies the UI when in the UI timeline a deployment window should be shown.
The sence for this behaviour is that the Operations-team can consider the deployments if a state of a element is in state "ERROR".
Screenshot of the timeline showing the deployment slot.
The deployment window is marked in blue color, means in that time a deployment of a service is running.
